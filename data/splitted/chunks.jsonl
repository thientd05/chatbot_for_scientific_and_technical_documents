{"content": "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English- to- German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English- to- French translation task, our model establishes a new single- model state- of- the- art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.", "metadata": {"heading": "Abstract  "}}

{"content": "Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states \\(h_{t}\\) , as a function of the previous hidden state \\(h_{t - 1}\\) , and the input for position \\(t\\) . This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional computation [20], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.", "metadata": {"heading": "1 Introduction  "}}

The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.", "metadata": {"heading": "1 Introduction  "}}
{"content": "The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [20]. ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [6], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate states from two different input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [11]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a seemingly number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention- weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi- Head Attention as described in section [32]", "metadata": {"heading": "2 Background  "}}
{"content": "Self- attention, sometimes called intra- attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence.

Given \\(\\mathbf{z}\\) , the decoder then generates an output sequence \\((y_{1},\\ldots ,y_{m})\\) of symbols one element at a time.

Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub- layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self- attention sub- layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are shifted by one position, ensures that the predictions for position \\(i\\) can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than \\(i\\) .", "metadata": {"heading": "3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks  "}}

{"content": "In \"encoder- decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder- decoder attention mechanisms in sequence- to- sequence models such as GPT [28]. The encoder contains self- attention layers. In a self- attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder. Similarly, self- attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to suppress the autoregressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot- product attention by masking out (setting to \\(- \\infty\\) ) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections.

One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long- range dependencies [1]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.", "metadata": {"heading": "4 Why Self-Attention  "}}

Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of \\(k\\) . Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to \\(O(k \\cdot n \\cdot d + n \\cdot d^{2})\\) .
