Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states \(h_{t}\) , as a function of the previous hidden state \(h_{t - 1}\) , and the input for position \(t\) . This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional computation [20], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.  


Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequence [21][22]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.  


In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.  


## 2 Background  


The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [20]. ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [6], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate states from two different input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [11]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a seemingly number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention- weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi- Head Attention as described in section [32]  


Self- attention, sometimes called intra- attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self- attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task- independent sentence representations [41][22][23][19].  


End- to- end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple- language question answering and language modeling tasks [28].  


To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self- attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence- aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self- attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [31][35] and [8].  


## 3 Model Architecture  


Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder- decoder structure [5][2][29]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations \((x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})\) to a sequence of continuous representations \(\mathbf{z} = (z_{1},\ldots ,z_{n})\) . Given \(\mathbf{z}\) , the decoder then generates an output sequence \((y_{1},\ldots ,y_{m})\) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is a single- sequence [9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.  


The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self- attention and point- wise fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right/hat/hats of Figure [1] respectively  


### 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks  


Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of \(N = 6\) identical layers. Each layer has two sub- layers. The first is a multi- head self- attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position
